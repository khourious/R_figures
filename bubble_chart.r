# The grepl() function is used to search for patterns in a character array and

# Here, we are selecting the columns from df whose names start with "NES_". 
# The result will be a vector with only the column names that meet this criterion.

# Now, the gsub() function is used to replace substrings within a string. 
# The command gsub("NES_", "", ...) will remove the substring "NES_" 
# from each column name that was previously selected.

# Transform the dataframe to long format
# This is the pipe operator (%>%) from the dplyr package,

# fluid way. It passes the dataframe df to the next function,
